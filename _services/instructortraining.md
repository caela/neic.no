Instructor training workshops to learn to organise and teach Carpentries and CodeRefinery workshops. Our train the trainer program aims at building partnerships with Research Software Engineers and researchers who are willing to lead skills' transfer within their local communities in the Nordics.
Within the NeIC Platinum membership within The Carpentries we have access to 15 instructor training seats per year. 

## Access policy
CodeRefinery instructors get precedence. The rest is given away on a first-comes, first-served basis. Eligable members to apply are: IT Center for Science Ltd (CSC) in Finland, Computing Services University of Iceland (CSUI), Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DeiC), Estonian Scientific Computing Infrastructure (ETAIS), Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) and UNINETT Sigma2 AS in Norway. Your academic home institution should be coupled to one of those.

Please contact the regional Carpentries coordinator for the Nordics/Baltics, [Naoe Tatara](https://neic.no/people/naoe-tatara/) if you want to get trained as an instructor.
